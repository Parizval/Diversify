## Description of Product

Diversify is a web application that aims to aid users to make sensible and informed investment choices. It makes use of graph theory to help choose the most diverse portfolio, that seeks to minimise the risk while providing a reasonable profit.

## Features
The features offered include:
    
    1)  Portfolio evaluation:
        The app allows users to enter their current portfolio and receive an estimate of 
        how well the companies that they are investing in have been doing in the recent past as 
        well as feedback on the diversity of their portfolio. 
     
     2)  Increased Diversification:
         This feature is intended to aid users who have investments at the moment but are seeking to expand
          their portfolio. It allows users to enter their current portfolio that they intend to add to, and
          the number of companies that they plan to add. The app offers suggestions based on which companies
          are most diverse while taking into account their existing portfolio. It also shows the users a recent 
          review of the performance of each of the companies on their expanded portfolio.
          
     3)  Portfolio Creation:

          the common pitfalls that haunt those that are new to the field. Users can enter the number of companies

          satisfy the criteria. They can also take a look at the recent performance of the companies that they

     4) Exit Strategy:
         It is must for any inverstor to have an exit strategy. Most people don't pay attention to it and thus hurt                               their chances of maximizing profits. We update the user about their portfolios in case of sudden movements in                           the market. The users are asked for their stop loss and take profits and are immediately notified once the set                           criterion is met.
